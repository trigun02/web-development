    <h1>Nicola Tesla</h1>
    <img src="nikola tesla2.jfif">
    <small ><p style="text-align:center;">Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,<br> and futurist best known for his
    contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.</p></small>
    
    <div><h2 style="text-align:center; text-decoration: underline;">About the Legend </h2>

        <p>☛Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in the Austrian Empire, now Croatia. He was the fourth of five children. After a
        checkered academic career in Europe, he worked as a telegraph drafter and electrician before moving to the United States
        to work for Thomas Edison in 1884.<br><br>

    ☛He studied engineering at the Technical University at Graz, Austria, and the University of Prague.<br><br>


    ☛In 1901, Tesla received financial backing from J. Pierpont Morgan to build his Wardenclyffe laboratory in Shoreham, Long
    Island. The facility included the “Tesla Tower,” a 185-foot high structure with a 65-foot copper dome transmitter on the
    top. Tesla’s vision was to use the tower to transmit signals and free, unlimited wireless electricity all over the
    world. Thanks to Tesla's early work, wireless transfer of energy is finally being realized today -- from wireless
    chargers for electric toothbrushes and smartphones, to wireless electric vehicle charging, a technology being researched
    at the Energy Department’s National Labs.<br><br>

    ☛“Teslas,” a unit used to measure the strength of magnetic fields, are named after Tesla. Another namesake is Tesla
    Motors, the electric car start-up, in homage to Tesla’s role in the invention of the electric motor.<br><br>

    ☛ Tesla designed the first hydroelectric power plant in Niagara Falls, New York, harnessing the power of the waterfalls he
    had marveled at since childhood. Construction took three years and power first flowed to homes in nearby Buffalo on Nov.
    16, 1896. A statue of Tesla on Goat Island overlooks the falls today.<br><br>

    ☛ During the war of the currents, alternating current (AC) -- favored by Tesla -- battled for wide acceptance with direct
    current (DC), favored by Edison. At stake was the basis for the entire nation’s electrical system. Edison launched a
    campaign against AC, claiming it was dangerous and could kill people; Tesla countered by publicly subjecting himself to
    250,000-volt shocks to demonstrate AC’s safety. Ultimately, alternating current won the fight.<br><br>

    ☛Tesla received his U.S. citizenship in 1891, the same year he invented the Tesla coil. Tesla coils are a type of
    electrical circuit used to generate low-current, high-voltage electricity. Today, they’re widely used in radios,
    televisions and other electronics, and can be used for wireless transmission. A coil at Tesla’s experimental station in
    Colorado Springs, Colorado, created 30-foot sparks that could be seen from 10 miles away.<br><br>

    ☛If you couldn’t imagine life without your TV remote, thank Nikola Tesla for making it possible. Tesla invented,
    predicted or contributed to development of hundreds of technologies that play big parts in our daily lives -- like the
    remote control, neon and fluorescent lights, wireless transmission, computers, smartphones, laser beams, x-rays,
    robotics and, of course, alternating current, the basis of our present-day electrical system.
